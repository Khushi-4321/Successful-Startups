#   Multiple Linear Regression Model

This project implements a multiple linear regression model to predict outcomes based on several input features. It includes data preprocessing, model training, prediction, and visualization.

##   Key Features

* Reads data from a CSV file (`Successful_Startups.csv`). [cite: 1]
* Handles categorical data using One-Hot Encoding. [cite: 1]
* Splits data into training and testing sets. [cite: 2]
* Trains a multiple linear regression model. [cite: 2]
* Predicts outcomes on the test set. [cite: 3]
* Visualizes actual vs. predicted values. [cite: 4]

##   Libraries Used

* `numpy`
* `pandas`
* `matplotlib`
* `scikit-learn` (`sklearn`)

##   Setup

1.  Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
2.  Install the required libraries:

    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
    ```
3.  Place the `Successful_Startups.csv` file in the same directory as the Python script or notebook.

##   Usage

Run the Python script or Jupyter Notebook to:

1.  Load the dataset.
2.  Preprocess the data.
3.  Train the multiple linear regression model.
4.  Generate predictions.
5.  View the results visually.

##   Dataset

The dataset used is `Successful_Startups.csv`, which contains data for the regression model. [cite: 1]

##   Code Description

* `multiple_linear_regression.ipynb`: Contains the Python code for the multiple linear regression model.

##   Visualization

The project includes a visualization that plots the actual values against the predicted values, providing a clear way to evaluate the model's performance. [cite: 4]
